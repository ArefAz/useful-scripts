# useful-scripts
I add some small python scripts here which are handy sometimes. I did not wrote all of them and some are collected from stackoverflow and github posts.

These scripts are tested on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and might not work on other OSs other than linux without editing os.system() commands.
